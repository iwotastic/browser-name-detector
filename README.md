# Browser Name Detector
Detects the true browser name of the browser the client is using. Not just the user-agent string. It's almost creepy.

## Install
Either download `main.js` or paste the following code in your HTML source.
```html
<script src="https://iwotastic.github.io/browser-name-detector/main.js"></script>
```

## Usage
Simply call the global `bnd()` function to view the client browser name.
